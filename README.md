# Northcoders news website

## Summary

This website was developed as part of a week long Northcoders front-end project.

Hosted on Netlify: 
https://edelw3iss-nc-news.netlify.app/

This front-end project was built to connect to the back-end API developed for my Northcoders back-end project (https://github.com/edelw3iss/be-nc-news).

The site has articles which can be viewed by topic and sorted with a range of queries.  Individual articles can be 'liked' and the signed in user (hardcoded in) can add and delete their own comments.

The site was built using React.
